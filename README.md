This repository serves as my documentation for the Consumer Goods: Ad-Hoc Analysis - MySQL Project.
It was created as a self-learning project for the course: [SQL Beginner to Advanced For Data Professionals](https://codebasics.io/courses/sql-beginner-to-advanced-for-data-professionals) by [Codebasics](https://codebasics.io/).

It showcases my competancy to work with MySQL Workbench and demonstrates my proficiency in essential SQL concepts like ........
